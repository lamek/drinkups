Alright, folks, strap in and grab your protein shakes (or, let's be honest, your beers)! It's the dawn of the "March Pushup Challenge," and the air is thick with anticipation... and maybe a faint whiff of gym socks. This is your official kickoff, where we separate the pushup pros from the drink-soaked posers!

In lane one, we have "Tank," the fitness freak, already boasting an absurd projected ratio of "infinity-to-one." He's basically living in a plank position. Next, "Sloppy" Joe, currently projecting a ratio of "one pushup per keg," a true testament to... something. Then, we have "Rich, The Old Guy," who is already muttering about "back in his day" and is surprisingly consistent. Finally, "Kevin, The Clown," who is predicting a "statistical anomaly" will propel him to victory. Teddy the trainer is just shaking his head. Let the games begin!
